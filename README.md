Presentation of Facts

The idea of this Project is to provide an open-source platform for people to present "statements" of fact in a presentation type format. You can "present" a statement, and in that statement are listed all facts, citations for each fact, facts will be linked to other facts, and the entire system will adjust to mark a statement as "true" or "false" based on the linked facts.

The primary intent of the platform is to drill down to real truth. The platform will also serve as a visual debating tool, as users can attach or remove facts from a statement, or debate upon and adjust the facts, which will alter the truthfulness of the statement.
